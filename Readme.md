Learn Python The Hard Way
=========================

This is my second tutorial for learning to code in Python.
After finishing my first python book: [Python for Kids](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADX21Z6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ADX21Z6&linkCode=as2&tag=wilyansinncir-20)ï¼Œ I found the previous book gives good idea about programming, but it is bit rush in explaining how coordinates of the images works. I gave feedbacks to my friend and she told me that it is intended by the author. 

"The only way to learn programming is through repetition and make your mind snap and one day you will get it. "

"What is next?" I asked, and she gave me this book: [Learn Python The Hard Way 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398515789&sr=8-1&keywords=learn+python+the+hard+way). 

"This is your next step" she said.

And here I am.
