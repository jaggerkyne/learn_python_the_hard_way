### Remember: Most of the uses of inheritance can be simplified or replaced
# with composition, and multiple inheritance should be avoided at all costs.

# Parent class is the base class in this example, Child is the subclass.

class Parent(object):

    def implicit(self):
        print "PARENT implicit()"

class Child(Parent):
    pass

dad = Parent()
son = Child()

dad.implicit()
