Notes for Exercise 16:
======================

I need to remember this list of methods to files:

    1. close() -> closes the file. Like File->Save.. in my editor.
    2. read() -> reads the contents of the file. The result can be assigned to a variable.
    3. readline() -> reads just one line of a txt file.
    4. truncate() -> empties the file. Be careful when use, it will wipe out the content of the file.
    5. write(stuff) -> writes stuff to the file.

Learn how to read documentation and do not simply copy and paste code.

w for write mode;
r for read mode;
a for append mode

we can also use w+,r+ and a+, it will open both read and write mode.
