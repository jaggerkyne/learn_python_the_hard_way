# typo error, car_pool_capacity does not exist

# 1. Use 4.0 for space_in_a_car is not necessary. if you change 4.0 into 4, the result will be 120.0 rather 120.

# 2. floating number means decimal numbers

# 3. done in ex4.py

# 4. "=" is the assignment symbol within python.

# 5. we use "_" to connect words to make the code more readable.

# 6. ^ is not power, x ** y is equal to (x^y) in other programming language
