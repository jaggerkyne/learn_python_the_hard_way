# 1. Take the remaining lines of the WYSS output and figure out what they are doing.
# Make sure you understand how you are running your functions in the ex25 module.

# 2. Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words). Notice how you get help for your module and how
# the help os those odd """ strings you put after each function in ex25? Those special strings are called documentation
# comments and we'll be seeing more of them.

# 3. Typing ex25. is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this: from ex25 import *, which is like saying,
# "Import everything from ex25." Programmers like saying things backwards. Start a new session and see how all your
# functions are right there.

# 4. Trying breaking your file and see what is looks like in Python when you use it. You will have to quit Python
# with CTRL-D(CTRL-Z on Windows) to be able to reload it.
