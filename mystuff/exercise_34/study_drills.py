# 1. Read about ordinal and cardinal numbers online
# http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/cardinal-ordinal-nominal.html
# Cardinal: how many; is for counting, no fractions and decimal
# Ordinal: position; is for the physical position orders of objects


# 2. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in
# "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random)
# "January 1, 2010" is cardinal as it is for counting the days after the birth of Jesus Christ. Year 2010 cannot be fractionlized.


# 3. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.

fruits = ['apple','strawberry','pear','peach','banana','kiwi fruit']

# 4. Use python to check your answer to this as well.

print "The first position of the fruits is %s " % fruits[0]
print "The index of pear is %d " % fruits.index('pear')
