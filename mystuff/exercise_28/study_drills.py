# 1. There are a lot of operators in Python similar to != and ==. Try to find out as many "equality operators" as you
# you can. They should be like < or <=

# Comparison Operators
# == equal
# != not equal
# <> not equal is deprecated
#       -> Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
# > greater
# < smaller
# <= smaller and equal to
# >= greater and equal to


# 2. Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example, I call != "not equal."

# 3. Play with the Python by typing out new boolean operators, and before you hit Enter, try to
# shout out what it is. Do not think about it-just name the first thing that comes to mind.
# write it down, then hit Enter, and keep track of how many you get right and wrong.

# 4. Throw away the piece of paper from #3 so you do not accidentally try to use it later.
