# 1. If you aren't really sure what return does, try writing a few of your own functions and have them return some
# values. You can return anything that you can put to the right of an =.

# 2. At the end of the script is a puzzle. I'm taking the return value of one function and using it as the argument of
# another function. I'm doing this in a chain so that I'm kind of creating a formula using the functions. It
# looks really weird, but it you run the script, you can see the results. What you should do is trying to figure out
# the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations.

# what = add(age,subtract(height,multiply(weight,divide(iq,2))))
# add(35,subtract(74,multiply(180,divide(50,2)))
# add(35,subtract(74,multiply(180,25)
# add(35,subtract(74,4500)
# add(35,-4426)
# -4391


# 3. Once you have the formula worked out for the puzzle, get in there and see what happens when you modify
# the parts of the functions. Try to change it on purpose to make another value.


# 4. Finally, do the inverse. Write out a simple formula and use the functions in the same way to calculate it.
#
# f(x) = 2x + 3
# the inverse of the above function is  x =(y-3)/2
# It is not possible to write a function to create inverse at this stage of human history.
# For our current limited understanding, not every function have a inverse.
